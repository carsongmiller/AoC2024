# Advent of Code Solutions - 2024

This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.  All solution in this repo should work, although they're not necessarily neither super fast nor optimal in any way.  My goal was to get more familiar with Java, and so in these solutions, you will find straightforward solutions that are hopefully fairly readable and understandable.

## How to run

Clone the repo, and replace all instances of "DayXX" in App.java with the number of the day you want.  You'll need to change the following lines (change the "08" to the day you want):
- `var inputFilePath = "inputs\\08.txt";`
- `System.out.println("Part 1: " + Day08.Part1(text));`
- `System.out.println("Part 2: " + Day08.Part2(text));`
